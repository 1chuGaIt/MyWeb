🚀 **The Community**: stay motivated and accountable with an academy of students. For a deeper experience, match into one of the three prestigious clubs based on your _brain type_ and compete in focus sprints and leaderboards.

## 2. The Study Smart Score
We use the _Study Smart Score_ to **evaluate your proficiency** with learning, productivity, and self-improvement. (Your data is kept confidential). You’ll take an assessment at baseline before you start the course, and periodically thereafter to track improvement and identify your next plan of action. Below is an example from one of our students:

Through Study Quest, you learned the ins and outs of what it takes to build a strong study system. You learned how to think critically about what she learned, how to stay consistent, improve her focus, and stay relaxed during periods of high stress.

With each new skill acquired, she was able to see improvement on her _Study Smart Score_.

As You 's confidence grew, so did her grades. To your surprise, you was seeing improvements not only in school, but in all areas of life. You was excited and inspired by how much progress you was making. You no longer dreaded going to class, you was enjoying the process.

Now as You looks back at your journey, you can't believe how far you's come. And neither could we. The _Study Smart Score_ helped your identify your pain points and focus in the right areas. By the time You graduated, you had transformed from a failing, struggling student to a confident and successful one, even making the Dean’s List!
