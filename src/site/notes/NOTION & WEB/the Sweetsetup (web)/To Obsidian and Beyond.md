_10 Videos_  
  
In the first module you'll discover how to take all the information you encounter — the things you read, the conversations you have, the ideas that come to you, the insights that strike from time to time, and more — and then organize it in a way that helps you get the most out of it.  
  
This goes beyond the typical "file" or "pile" approach to organization. And it shows you why being able to actually connect and link your ideas is far more powerful.  
  
(Honestly, you already have a way that you manage all your knowledge, You just may not realize it... which means it could be better.)

# 5. ### The Focus Course  
(Premium Only)

_Our flagship training course on Focus, Clarity, Goal Setting, and Habits._  
  
This is the first time we've ever offered [The Focus Course](https://thefocuscourse.com/course/) as part of a bundle to our TSS readers. We believe it fits perfectly with the Obsidian course because of the strong emphasis on doing your best creative work.  
  
As a Focus Course member, you'll discover the 5 Components of a Focused Life and how to use them to get absolute clarity on what matters most (both in your life and in your daily tasks). We'll show you how to turn that clarity into goals, and how to make regular progress on your goals by finally building habits that work in your favor.  
  
This is the same training that thousands of people have gone through since 2015, and which we have presented at live workshops, online cohorts, private corporate trainings, and more. (Read more about The Focus Course [here](https://thefocuscourse.com/course/).)


### 1: Components of a Focused Life

The whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. These five components make up the core framework inside Focus Course Academy. You will discover what each component is, how they tie together, and then how to use them as a tool for both diagnosing and solving problems related to your habits, schedule, tasks, goals, and motivation.

  

### 2: Your Life's Mission

Here you will get to use our unique and powerful approach to crafting your life's mission. Instead of leaving you with a blank sheet of paper and expecting you to pull something out of the air, you will get to use our "Mission Map" — a systematic template that helps you easily identify the most important areas and then funnel that into your own unique life visions statement. From there, you get to refine and edit.

  

### 3: The 8 Laws of Focus

The primary expressions of focus in your life is twofold: (1) the attainment of focus in the form of a clear vision and priorities; and (2) the skill of focus in the form of your ability to direct your attention on to that which matters. As such, there are 8 Laws of Focus which you need to know and use in order to get and stay clear, and also to follow through on doing the important work that matters.

  

### 4: Delightful Goal Setting (Big & Small)

You will identify life goals for each of the 6 major areas of your life and discover how your small actions tie in to the larger desired outcomes you have.

  

### 5: Your Cornerstone Habit (Strategy & Action Plan)

Life is almost entirely made up of small, usually-inconsequential choices and moments each day. The little things we do (and don’t do) are what paint the picture of our life. If you want a different life, make a small change to something and stick with it.

Session 5 and 6 are the apex of the Course. These lessons are when most of our members have their "lightbulb" moments, and the results from this week are often what make the biggest, long-term impact on people.

  

### 6: Time Management & Your Ideal Schedule

Managing your time is unto the living of your life. How you spend your time is, quite literally, how you are living our life. In this section on time ownership, elimination, delegation, and your ideal schedule we will discover how to reduce your commitments and priorities and how to establish time in your schedule for doing the things that you value and that only you can do.

  

### 7: Overcome the Obstacles

Any great endeavor will elicit resistance. No doubt you have set out on a goal before, only to be derailed at some point. We've identified 7 primary areas of resistance, what they are, and how you can overcome them so as not to get derailed.

  

### 8: How to Live A Life with Margin

Margin is a necessary component of a focused life. Do you have the breathing room, health, and strength you need in order to lean into each area of your life? Margin exists for relationships and thus it enables you to be present for your most important roles and responsibilities in life. A life without margin is a life on the edge of burnout.
